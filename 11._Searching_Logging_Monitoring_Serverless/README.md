## DevOps Principle

This module emphasizes the DevOps principle of **Continuous Feedback**:
- Measure everything
- Ask questions and understand the data
- Use insights to improve your product and processes

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Throughout these notes, we'll discuss important KPIs for your backend systems:
- CPU load on servers
- Total and active user counts
- Infrastructure costs
- Request throughput and latency
- Error rates and availability
