## What is DevOps?
ref: *what is devops? A Systematic Mapping Study on Definitions and Practices* by *Luis Felipe F. Perrone, Daniel M. German, Emad Shihab*


DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 

- It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology.


## What is DevOps for a 25-30 year old?

DevOps is a 
- set of practices that 
    - combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).

aim: 
- shorten and optimize the systems development life cycle
- shared stake of Development and Operations

1. The First Way: The Principles of Flow
2. The Second Way: The Principles of Feedback
3. The Third Way: The Principles of Continual Learning and Experimentation


### The First Way: The Principles of Flow

- Make Work Visible
- Limit Work in Progress
    - WIP: Work in Progress 
    - limit tasks in 'doing' state
- Reduce Batch Sizes
    - smaller batch sizes 
    - smaller changes
    - smaller tasks 
- Reduce the Number of Handoffs
    - between teams, departments, etc.
    - idea: handoffs are waste 
- Continually Identify and Evaluate Contraints
    - identify bottlenecks
    - evaluate constraints
    - remove constraints
- Eliminate Hardships and Waste in the Value Stream 
    - ease tools, process and practices 
        - fx. MakeFile, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
        - MakeFile: build automation tool
            - make used to create shortcuts for commands



### The Second Way: The Principles of Feedback

- See Problems as They Occur
    - monitor systems
    - log systems
    - alert systems

- Swarm and Solve Problems to Build New Knowledge
    - swarm: gather around a problem
    - solve: solve the problem
    - build new knowledge: learn from the problem

- Keep Pushing Quality Close to the Source
    - fx. linter 

    - push quality to the source
    - quality is everyone's responsibility
    - quality is not a separate department

- Enable Optimizing for Downstream Work Centers
    - (not really relevant for software development)


### The Third Way: The Principles of Continual Learning and Experimentation

- Institutionalize the Improvement of Daily Work 


- Transform Local Discoveries int Global Improvements
    - in software development group 
        - docs for not only finished code increment, but also for the process of creating the code increment
        - 


## Information silos vs. knowledge silos


## DevOps is People 

### PPT framework - people, process, technology
