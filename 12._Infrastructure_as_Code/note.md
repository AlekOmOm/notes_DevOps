# Notes on Infrastructure as Code (Lesson 12)

## Core Concepts from Overview (01-overview-of-iac.md)

*   **IaC Definition:** Applying software development practices to infrastructure provisioning and configuration. Infrastructure is defined as resources in code.
*   **Modularity & Composability:** Defining infrastructure as code enables:
    *   **Modularity:** Breaking down infrastructure into smaller, reusable, manageable code components (modules), similar to functions/classes in software.
    *   **Composability:** Combining these independent modules to build larger, more complex environments. This leverages code reuse and simplifies building stacks.

## Terraform Core Workflow (05-terraform-get-started.md)

*   **Configuration Files (`*.tf`):** Define the desired state of the infrastructure using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
*   **`terraform init`:** Initializes the working directory. Reads configuration files to determine required providers (e.g., Azure, AWS), downloads them, and sets up the backend for state storage. Requires at least one `.tf` file to exist.
*   **`terraform plan`:** Reads configuration files (`.tf`) and the current state file (`terraform.tfstate`). Compares the desired state (code) with the actual state (or last known state) and generates an *execution plan*. This plan details what Terraform *will* do (create, update, delete resources) to reach the desired state. It does *not* make any changes.
*   **`terraform apply`:** Executes the actions proposed in the execution plan generated by `terraform plan`. Prompts for confirmation before making changes unless a saved plan file or the `-auto-approve` flag is used. This is the command that modifies the actual infrastructure.
