## What is Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to infrastructure management that applies software development practices to infrastructure provisioning and configuration. Instead of manually setting up servers, networks, and other infrastructure components through a GUI or command line, IaC defines these resources in code.

This code is then executed by tools that automatically provision and configure the required infrastructure, ensuring consistent, repeatable environments every time.

### Core Concepts:

- **Version Control**: Infrastructure definitions are stored in version control systems like Git
- **Declarative Definitions**: Infrastructure is defined as a desired end state
- **Automation**: Provisioning happens programmatically without manual intervention
- **Idempotency**: Running the same code multiple times produces the same environment

## Key DevOps Principle

The key DevOps principle for Infrastructure as Code is:

> **Repeatable, Reliable, Redeployable**

This captures the essence of what IaC aims to achieve:

- **Repeatable**: The same infrastructure can be deployed consistently every time
- **Reliable**: Infrastructure deployments are predictable and free from human error
- **Redeployable**: Infrastructure can be torn down and rebuilt easily when needed

## Benefits of IaC

IaC offers numerous advantages for modern DevOps practices:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Consistency** | Eliminates configuration drift across environments |
| **Speed** | Automates infrastructure provisioning, reducing deployment time |
| **Scalability** | Makes it easy to duplicate environments or add resources |
| **Documentation** | The code itself documents the infrastructure |
| **Version Control** | Changes can be tracked, audited and rolled back |
| **Testing** | Infrastructure can be tested like application code |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Enables quick recovery from failures |
| **Collaboration** | Teams can review and contribute to infrastructure code |

## IaC in the Software Development Lifecycle

IaC integrates into the SDLC in several key ways:

1. **Development**: Developers can create consistent local environments
2. **Testing**: QA teams can spin up identical test environments
3. **Staging**: Pre-production environments match production exactly
4. **Production**: Deployments are reliable and predictable
5. **Maintenance**: Changes follow the same workflow as application code

This integration helps eliminate the traditional friction between development and operations teams, a core goal of DevOps.
